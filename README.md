- 👋 Hi, I’m Saheed Adekunle Raji
- 👀 I’m interested in land change science, ecosystem service modeling, geo-sustainability sciences, and spatially-explicit research.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a research that investigates the driving factors of soil erosion in a tropical sedimentary basin using MLR.
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaborations on understanding the spatial dynamics influencing the food-water-climate nexus from the natural capital approach.
- 📫 Feel free to mail me: raji.saheed@fupre.edu.ng, & rsa.oluwaseun@gmail.com.
